        "The primary active compounds of American Ginseng are called ginsenosides. Ginsenosides support your nervous system by protecting and promoting the growth of brain cells. These bioactives also help calm the bodyâ€™s stress response by tuning down overactivity in your HPA axis (your stress system) for greater emotional balance.",
